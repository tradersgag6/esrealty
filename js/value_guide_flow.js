/* The Value Guide's reference calculation.
 *
 * Clean-room implementation of the LandValuePH published methodology: a BIR
 * zonal base, a market-indicator factor, one additive net of twelve published
 * question factors, and a replacement-cost building component. It reuses the
 * storefront estimator for everything that is NOT pricing - the BIR lookup,
 * coverage metadata, ownership review, comparables and transaction options -
 * and overwrites only the arithmetic, so the two calculators cannot drift on
 * provenance while still disagreeing on the answer by design.
 *
 * Provenance of every constant below is recorded in
 * docs/specs/value-guide-3-step.md §2. Rate constants come from LandValuePH's
 * shipped client bundle and from the purchased report LVPH-D-9531904C; the
 * bundle's display chip and the report's own arithmetic disagree on CHB
 * (15,000 vs 16,000) and the report wins, because 16,000 x 120 sqm is the
 * figure that reconciles to the printed building value.
 *
 * There is deliberately no valuation year and no escalation factor. That was
 * proposed, tested against PSA construction statistics and rejected: PSA's
 * national residential average fell from 14,429 (Jan 2025) to 14,081.64 (May
 * 2026) while CMRPI materials grew 1.3%/yr, so no published source supports a
 * 2%/yr uplift, and the uplift was worth only 1.1% of the total. */
