  Sweeps tests\ui_no_overflow_e2e.js across the viewport widths where the public
  storefront has actually overflowed horizontally.

  Both defects this catches were 320px-only: the contact form's
  .sf-reveal-right resting offset pushed it to x=75 in a 320px viewport, and the
  results bar's inner flex group ran to x=359. Because .sf-site clips
  overflow-x, neither produced a scrollbar - the content was just cut off, and a
  single-width run at 1280px sees a perfectly healthy page.
