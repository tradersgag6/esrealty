     G2 was GREEN on the first run. Every check then present was also

     G2 re-run to confirm it is now RED. Recorded because the whole
     point of this file is that a guard nobody can distinguish from its
     opposite is not a guard.

     On G12: the accuracy guard has NO discriminating power over
     today's code. Every banned term is planted in one of the three fixed
     strings, and the verbatim assertions on `multipleLabel`, `assumption`
     and `limitation` fire first - 285 lines before the guard is reached
     (measured, not estimated: the assertion below is at line 422 and the
     verbatim `multipleLabel` assertion at line 137) - so the run goes RED
     without the guard ever executing. That is
     correct behaviour, not a defect: a banned term cannot reach the copy. But
     it does mean the guard proves nothing yet. Its value is forward-looking,

     docs/batangas-value-guide-sources.md:50-58 enforceable instead of
     aspirational. Two halves, and both matter: a positive control proving
     the regex actually bites (a guard that can never match is a green lie),
     and the negative assertion on the real copy.

     Widened in Task 2 fix round 1. Three gaps let real variants through:
       - `\baccur\w*` has no word boundary inside "inaccurate", so the most
         natural way to break the rule - denying accuracy - was unguarded.
       - `\bprecision\b` missed "precise" and "precisely".
       - `within \d+\s*%` missed "within 5 percent", which is the spelled-out
         form a human writing prose is likelier to reach for.
     The published copy is fixed and contains none of these, so widening
     cannot produce a false positive today; it matters because Tasks 3 and 4
     introduce prose that is NOT pinned verbatim and can only be policed by
     this regex.

     Widened again in Task 3 fix round 1, adding `close to` and `exact match`.
     Task 2 declined them deliberately; Task 3 is the first task whose
     RENDERER owns prose, so the guard has to police it. Task 2's reason for
     declining - "they are not asserted, so the gap is invisible" - was the
     defect: a term the regex cannot catch looks identical to a clean copy
     until the day someone writes the phrase. Both are now asserted in the
     positive control below. Neither occurs in the fixed copy, so this cannot
     false-positive today. */

     Task 3 - the HTML render.

     The result screen and the report build-up are one string concatenation
     each, inside functions that are not exported, so a source grep can only
     ever say that some characters exist somewhere in the file. The checks
     below drive the real renderer instead. js/estimator.js is loaded into a
     vm context with a minimal document, the wizard state is set the way
     runEstimate() sets it, and renderLayout() is asked for screen 4. What
     comes back is the exact innerHTML the reader sees, with nothing inside
     the renderer stubbed or re-implemented.

     Only the disclosure builder is wrapped, in two ways: permanently, to
     count calls per render, and temporarily, with a marked copy, to prove
     the markup prints what the builder returned rather than a second copy
     of the words.

     This is what gives the accuracy guard above its teeth. Over the
     published copy it never executes, because the verbatim assertions fire
     first - see the note there. Over the RENDERED text it does run, and a
     banned word planted in the renderer's own connective prose reaches it.
     Mutation proof for that is recorded on the check itself. */

     Task 4 - the PDF.

     pdfText() below is a copy of the helper in
     tests/value_guide_reference_node.js:11-20. That file exports nothing, so
     the helper cannot be imported from it, and the alternative - adding an
     export to a file this task must not touch - is worse. It is a harness,
     not part of the feature: it inflates the content streams and reads the
     hex text runs back out. Nothing inside the renderer is replaced.

     Every PDF below comes from VG.toBlob() with the vendored pdf-lib bundle,
     the same call tests/value_guide_reference_node.js:80-82 makes inside its
     --capture branch. meta carries no tax figures: the disclosure is not a tax
     output, and a fixture that dragged the tax engine in would be testing the
     tax path instead.

     Mutations, run against this file on 2026-10-04, each applied to
     js/value_guide_pdf.js and then reverted. The run aborts at the first
     throw, so only the check named in each entry was OBSERVED red - later
     checks that would also have fired were not exercised to failure:
        M20. the label hardcoded as a byte-identical literal
          -> "the PDF prints the builder's own strings, once each" FAILS,
             "expected the builder's 6 interpolated fields to be marked, found
             5". Nothing before it turned red.
        M21. the assumption paragraph dropped
          -> "the PDF land build-up prints the label, the factor and both
             published sentences" FAILS, "the assumption sentence is not printed
             verbatim"
        M22. the limitation paragraph dropped
          -> the same check FAILS, "the limitation sentence is not printed
             verbatim"
        M23. the summary line dropped
          -> "the PDF summary names the applied multiple under the BIR figure"
             FAILS, "the summary never prints the label", and only that one
        M24. the build-up row's value hardcoded as "x 2.5"
          -> "the printed multiple reconciles with the printed BIR base and
             land rate" FAILS, "commercial corner: the build-up prints 2.5 where
             the builder returns 4.35625". The vacant lot and house lot vectors
             on the same check stayed green - a 2.5 hardcode is correct for
             those two, which is why that check reads three fixtures.
        M25. the summary guard dropped and a locally forged disclosure
          substituted whenever the builder returns null
          -> "a time-indexed result renders no disclosure anywhere in the PDF"
             FAILS, "the indexed PDF still names the factor" (index 440)
        M25b. the same forgery, restricted to factor-mode results
          -> "the factor build-up prints nothing when the builder returns null"
             FAILS, "the silenced PDF still names the factor anywhere"
             (index 435), with the indexed check green - which is the point of
             running both variants
        M26, M27, M28. see the note on the static source guard below
        M29. the browser branch bound to the wrong global
          (window.ESREALTY_REFERENCE -> window.ESREALTY_FINANCE, a global that
          does exist in that context)
          -> the browser-branch check fails with "TypeError:
             referenceTools.appliedMultipleDisclosure is not a function", after
             every text assertion above it stayed green. It is the only check

/* ---- the browser branch of the binding ----

     js/value_guide_pdf.js binds the disclosure builder the way
     js/estimator.js does - require() under Node, window.ESREALTY_REFERENCE in
     the browser. Every PDF above went through the require() branch, so the
     browser branch is never executed by any suite in this file, and
     tests/value_guide_pdf_browser_e2e only proves that clicking Download still
     produces a PDF: a browser build whose referenceTools came back undefined
     would fail at the first call, and that suite's text assertions would never
     reach the disclosure either way.

     So the browser branch is executed here, for real: the three scripts the
     renderer needs are loaded into a context with no module and no exports, in
     index.html's order (value_guide_finance, value_guide_reference,
     value_guide_pdf - the first is there because the renderer requires it for
     the transaction-costs row), and the renderer is asked for a PDF through its
     own global.

     pdf-lib is evaluated inside that context too, and the reason is a harness
     one, recorded rather than worked around: pdf-lib's option type checks use
     instanceof, and the renderer's A4 page-size literal is an Array belonging

  /* ---- the brief's static source guard, kept alongside the real ones ----
     A shape check, not behavioural coverage, and labelled as such: it can only
     see that the characters exist in the file. What is printed is pinned by the
     assertions above. It is here for the one defect text extraction is blind to,
     and blindness was measured rather than assumed.

     Two mutations, both applied to js/value_guide_pdf.js on 2026-10-04:
       M26. drop `.filter(...)` and hand landRows to table() unfiltered
            -> the render THROWS: "TypeError: Cannot read properties of null
               (reading 'length')" at js/value_guide_pdf.js:347, on the first
               fixture that reaches the branch with a null disclosure. So the
               filter is load-bearing and the silenced fixture above exercises
               it for real - the crash is the coverage.
       M27. keep the filter but make the falsy branch `[null]` instead of
            `null` -> ALL GREEN (63 checks). table() accepts a one-element row,
            wrap() renders an empty cell as no ink at all, the row is at an even
            index so no shade band is drawn either, and the cost is 17.46pt of
            blank vertical space that no extracted text can show.

     M27 is the reason the falsy branch is pinned here rather than trusted. It
     is the only defect in this feature that behavioural assertions cannot see.

     M28. add a second, unreachable resolution site
          -> "expected exactly one resolution site in js/value_guide_pdf.js,
             found 2". A renderer that called the builder per printed field
             would pass every presence check above, because the words would
             still be the builder's - this is the only thing that sees it. */
