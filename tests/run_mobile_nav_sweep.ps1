  Sweeps the mobile-navigation suite across the viewport widths where the
  navigation has actually broken.

  The dead band (901-1050px: hamburger visible, panel could never open) only
  appears at one width, so a single-width run cannot catch it. This re-runs
  tests\ui_mobile_nav_e2e.js at each width in turn and aggregates the result.
